# RPC

Remote Procedure Call support on Quilibrium allows hybridized offline-online mode, making management of common network assets (Accounts, Coins, Transactions) for more complex key management scenarios possible. 
This document serves to capture both the raw RPC documentation following the protobufs, and then specific management scenarios for cold custody, warm/hot custody, and MPC custody. 

:::danger

It is critical to understand that in order to maintain the privacy of your account, that use of these RPCs is kept within secure trust boundaries â€“ do not use an RPC server you do not control, and ensure that your connection to this RPC is secure and encrypted.

:::

## Protobufs/Node RPC

### Structure

Node RPC services take the form of the primary entity being interacted with, followed by Service. 
The RPCs under the service are the names of the operations themselves, expecting a message named `Decryptable<Operation><Entity>Request` as the argument. 
The response message name follows the format of `<Operation><Entity>Response`. 
If an operation requires inputs from multiple parties and must follow stages, the response type is a stream to encapsulate the state changes as expected messages.

### Refs and AccountRefs

Generally, Ref types are simply hypergraph references by address, with the exception of AccountRefs, which have a special consideration in being either originated (e.g. created as an explicit entity on the network and referenced like any other Ref) or implicit (e.g. bound to and derived from a specific key and key type). 
The latter is important for many "cold" key management operations, where a key is generated and lives completely offline from the network, restored only to perform operations such that all resources allocated to the key material has been transferred to another key, either cold or under a different custodial strategy.

```
message OriginatedAccountRef {
  bytes address = 1;
}
 
message ImplicitAccount {
  uint32 implicit_type = 1;
  bytes address = 2;
  bytes domain = 3;
}
 
message AccountRef {
  oneof account {
    OriginatedAccountRef originated_account = 1;
    ImplicitAccount implicit_account = 2;
  }
}
```

In the `ImplicitAccount` case, the type specifier indicates the kind of implicit account it is, with 0 being a default key-derived account (Poseidon-hashed raw public key), 1 being a WebAuthN-derived account (Poseidon-hashed raw public key), which requires the corresponding domain name for validation scope. 
The type leaves room for additional key/signature support in the future.

### Request Envelopes

Because data on Quilibrium is encrypted, and general network operations can only be conducted with the requisite key material to perform decryption as part of the operations, RPC methods mirror the actual application methods, but have a wrapper message for the caller to provide relevant information to perform the actual network interaction. 
Structurally, the request envelopes contain the request itself, a keyring collection, and optionally, if the request produces side effects regarding key management, the delivery strategy for communicating these updates:

```
message Decryptable<Operation><Entity>Request {
  <Operation><Entity>Request request = 1;
  KeyRing key_ring = 2;
  DeliveryMethod delivery_method = 3;
}
```

The key ring is simply a collection of relevant keys: most importantly, the decryption keys for referenced assets. 
In the event mutations on those given assets are performed, the reference takes a transactional lock.

```
message InlineKey {
  bytes ref = 1;
  bytes key = 2;
}
 
message KeyRing {
  repeated InlineKey keys = 1;
}
```

Delivery method indicates the delivery strategy, where the default type, 0, specifies normal inbox-driven delivery for all notifiable parties of key updates and additions. 
If type is 1, it is the omission of deliveries. 
To ensure network consistency and that it is not possible to induce an inaccessible state for relevant parties, the 
relevant keys for all notifiable parties **must** be provided in the key ring. 
Address is used to disambiguate the sender in the event multiple identifiable parties are present in the key ring.

```
message DeliveryMethod {
  uint32 delivery_type = 1;
  bytes address = 2;
}
```

### AccountService

The `quilibrium.node.node.pb.AccountService` RPC exposes a few simple operations for common account management:

```
service AccountService {
  rpc Allow(DecryptableAllowAccountRequest) returns (AllowAccountResponse);

## Management Scenarios

### Cold Custody

Cold custody is a process which generally takes place in a secure airgapped environment, where key generation is controlled under a formally audited process, with secure custody management of the private key material, and either the raw public key or derivation information of the public key is provided, sometimes including additional data like a signature to prove key material was generated correctly. 
Cold custody management scenarios typically consider any interaction with an online world to be a transition point where the key becomes classified as "warm" or "hot", and is no longer suitable for long term usage. 
For cold custody operations, it is therefore advisable to have an account configuration of the following:

1. The account to receive assets is an implicit account, of [`type 0`](#refs-and-accountrefs).
2. If desired to avoid users providing key info for the pending transaction, the initial signature should be a singular operation for the network, to permit a warm/hot key to perform at least [`ListPendingTransactions`](#listpendingtransactions), which can be relayed via the RPC after the cold key production process is completed.

```
AllowAccountRequest{
  OfAccount: &AccountRef{
    Account: &ImplicitAccount{
      ImplicitType: 0,
      Address: <derivedPoseidonHash>,
    },
  },
  PermittedAccount: &AccountRef{
    Account: <accountToGiveReadRights>,
  },
  PermittedOperations: []string{"account:ListPendingTransactions"},
  Signature: &Signature{
    SignatureType: 0,
    Signature: <rawSigBytes>,
    Key: &KeyRef{
      Address: <derivedPoseidonHash>,
    },
  },
}
```

3. Then monitor ongoing pending transactions from the RPC using the permitted key.

```
PendingTransactionsAccountRequest{
  Account: &AccountRef{
    Account: &ImplicitAccount{
      ImplicitType: 0,
      Address: <derivedPoseidonHash>,
    },
  },
  Allowance: &AccountAllowanceRef{
    Address: <addressOfAllowance>,
  },
  Signature: <signatureOfAccountGivenRights>,
}
```

4. When the cold key is desired to come online, it can be used with the subsequent accept/reject operation, and then 
transfer or mutual transfer operations.

### Warm/Hot Custody

Warm/Hot custody operations are more straightforward in comparison, but generally there are important limits to be concerned with in terms of assets under the custody of the key. 
In this case, accepting and rejecting the pending transactions is a matter of ongoing operations, unless the mutual transfer scenario is desired. 
The other RPC that will typically be important for monitoring is the [`GetBalance`](#getbalance) and [`ListCoins`](#listcoins) operations.

### MPC Custody

MPC custodial operations traditionally perform signatures entirely within the infrastructure of the custodian, but if there are circumstances where this is not desired, you can utilize the network's Key Management application to perform MPC signing over the network, across two or more parties. 
The output key generated can subsequently be used as an [`ImplicitAccount`](#refs-and-accountrefs) for the relevant 
operations previously 
outlined.
