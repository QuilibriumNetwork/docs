# FAQ

### Is there a Q explorer (like Etherscan)?
Not yet, but there can be one to a limited degree. The network has overall active proof state, prover rings, total supply. These are things that anyone can see. The contents of transactions or their settled states are however invisible unless you possess relevant key material to the transaction. It is likely someone will build an explorer, and it will be globally less useful than Monero's explorers for transaction info, but could be made useful for individuals running multi-legged auth operations to see their own personal state.
Note the above applies only to native QUIL. wQUIL remains queryable via block explorers.

### What happens to wQUIL (ERC20) after the 2.0 launch?
wQUIL will remain active and transferrable/tradable as it is today. QUIL holders will continue to be able to bridge to wQUIL as they wish, and wQUIL holders will be able to bridge back to native QUIL with the 2.0 launch.

### What is next on the Q roadmap after 2.0?
After the 2.0 launch, the focus will be building out developer documentation and the fundamental services of the Internet that people enjoy such as file storage (i.e., S3), executable code, and domain services.

### What are people building on Q right now?
Not everything is ready to share publicly just yet but several public community projects include collectables/NFTs, node managers, Howler (flagship demo app, Discord alternative) and decentralized exchanges.

### Is there going to be a Q native DEX?
Absolutely.

### What are the official Q socials? How come there is no official X, Telegram, Discord?
The [Discourse forum](https://quilibrium.discourse.group/) is intended to be the primary communications channel for the near term. It was a decision early in the project to embrace as much decentralized tools as possible, and if not present, that their absence serves as a forcing function to make them exist. Discord especially, as the project started from a discord alternative.
