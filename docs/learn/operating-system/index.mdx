# Operating System

Here we define the operating system layer of Quilibrium, in which we build a [Database Operating System](./dbos) on the hypergraph database, realizing common OS primitives, such as a [File System](./file-system), [Scheduler](./scheduler), [IPC](./ipc)-like equivalent, [Message Queueing](./message-queues), [Control Key Management](./key-management), then finally a [Universal Resource](./universal-resources) pattern, in which we globally define resources, and unique instances of those resources, initially with an [Account](./accounts) resource, which tracks the balance of individual holdersâ€™ network reward tokens, unifying the reward structure at the most base level of the protocol all the way up the architectural stack.
