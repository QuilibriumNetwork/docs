# Oblivious Hypergraph

With a network formally constructed that manages arbitrary block storage, we now incorporate the messaging structure that enables arbitrary queryability, expressing this block storage as the data settlement layer of a hypergraph.
In the context of oblivious data structures, this particular construction is oblivious in the sense that evaluating queries is unclear to the nodes processing the requests as to whether or not the request evaluated data corresponding to specific edges and vertices of the hypergraph, the requestor is blind to the contents of any additional data served to it, and someone who has a complete ingestion of the network cannot determine any meaningful data about the contents, structure, or relevant processors of the hypergraph.
In the context of oblivious transfer-based communication, the oblivious hypergraph is realized utilizing OT based communication.
