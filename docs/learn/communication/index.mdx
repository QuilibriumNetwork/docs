# Foundations: Communication

Communication between nodes is the fundamental building block upon which the network is constructed. 
The network's communication can be separated out into four components: the [Planted Clique Addressing Scheme](.
/addressing.md), E2EE via the [Triple-Ratchet Protocol](./e2ee), Shuffled Lattice Routing Protocol, and the P2P 
[Gossip Layer](./p2p-communication). 
These components are explained in this section in completion to the extent they are isolated, however they are combined in the Block Storage section to fulfill the construction of a data store for a hypergraph.
