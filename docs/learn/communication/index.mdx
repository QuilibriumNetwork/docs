# Foundations: Communication

The network's communication between nodes is the fundamental building block on which the rest of the network is built upon.

In order to explain the how the network facilitates communication between nodes, the communication topic needs be separated into four components: 
 1. [Network addressing](./addressing) of content and applications
 2. [End-to-end Encryption](./e2ee) accomplished by the Triple-Ratchet Protocol
 3. [Mixnet Routing](./mixnet-routing) by the Shuffled Lattice Routing Protocol
 4. [P2P Communications](./p2p-communication) by extending the GossipSub protocol into BlossomSub.

It should be noted that the explanations found here are done in isolation and are combined with the [Block Storage components](/docs/learn/block-storage/) to fulfill the construction of a data store for a hypergraph.
